              12 years ago, a vicious tailed beast known as the Nine-Tails, attacked the shinobi
              village of Konohagakure. Many shinobi fought the beast, but it defeated and killed
              all those that stood in front of it. Luckily, the town was saved when the village's
              leader, the Fourth Hokage,  at the cost of his own sealed the beast with an infant boy
              life: Naruto Uzumaki.
